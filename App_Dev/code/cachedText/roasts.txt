She has such long black hair, it looks like a raven's wing! Her white shirt is so bright, it looks like the sun is shining! But don't be fooled, she's really quite sly, she'll make you think she's an angel but she'll roast you in the blink of an eye!

Well, it's hard to roast someone who's so tech-savvy they can even find their way in the dark. But, I guess if you want to be an expert on cell phones, you should probably start off by learning how to find the light switch.

Well if it isn't the woman who thought four eyes were better than two!  You must be seeing double the fun with those glasses on!


demo/alvmkzbhym.png // 

You must be brushing your teeth so hard, it's like you're trying to forget all the bad decisions you've made in life!


demo/glykuucrar.png // 

Your head's so high in the clouds, you can't even see how much everyone below you is laughing at you.


demo/foostvldmb.png // 

You must be trying to take the perfect selfie, but all you're really doing is taking a perfect example of how vanity can be blinding.


demo/ocstrfyyzb.png // 

Girl you must have thought this drink was gonna fix your problems, but it looks like you're still stuck with the same old you!


demo/ytifpzbwra.png // 

Girl, you must have left your hair dye in the window, 'cause the sun is tryin' to get away from you!


demo/qyzjrbueqz.png // 

You must be so addicted to your phone, that you’d rather spend time texting than talking to people in person. You must have a million notifications to keep you busy, but maybe you should take a break and talk to someone in real life.

Well I guess the only thing she forgot to do was add a sign that said, "No Mask Required!"


demo/pmzahzpiwc.png // 

"You take a million selfies, don't you? You must think you look great, but the only thing that reflects in that mirror is your vanity!"


demo/eznbpqpvcb.png // 

You look so funny making that face it's like you asked the group to pay admission to watch your comedy show!


demo/bauuampgtp.png // 

This guy must be feeling pretty special standing next to you, because you're like a window - always looking out for yourself!


demo/qebjwgbciz.png // 

You must have been dropped on your head as a baby, because that's the only explanation for why you're sitting in front of a window like some kind of weirdo!


demo/truzkbqjhn.png // 

You must be the keymaster 'cause you sure know how to hit all the wrong notes!


demo/pvzovogaho.png // 

One man says to the other: "You should really upgrade, you've been stuck on that same phone since the beginning of time!"


demo/tpnwlaaaxh.png // 

You must be so proud of yourself, always looking down at your phone like you're the king of the world. Unfortunately, you're still stuck in your parent's basement.


demo/tliactxyhv.png // 

Girl, you must have taken a wrong turn somewhere, because the only thing you're cooking up is an awkward selfie in the kitchen!


demo/IMG-1075.jpg // 

This woman must have a serious hoarding problem, she's got so much junk here it's starting to look like a landfill!


demo/IMG-1075.jpg // 

This lady must really be into recycling, she's so close to that pile of junk she's practically rolling in it!


demo/IMG-1075.jpg // 

You may have a lot of junk, but you have nothing on your personality!


demo/IMG-2176.png // 

You must be so desperate to keep your identity a secret that you even put a mask on your house.


demo/IMG-1075.jpg // 

You must have a lot of stuff, because it looks like you're hoarding a junkyard!


demo/IMG-2177.jpg // 

You're so high up, you must have been hired by NASA to check for aliens because no one else is as out of touch with reality as you!


demo/IMG-2179.png // 

Your work ethic is so bad, when your boss asked you to stay late you said, "I'd rather stay home and play with my head!"


demo/IMG-2179.png // 

You must be really proud of yourself, sitting there with your hands behind your head like you own the place. Well, I guess you do own the place, because nobody else wants to work here!


demo/IMG-2179.png // 

You must be so proud of yourself, sitting there like you own the place, with your hands behind your head like you're the king of the desk!


demo/IMG-2181.jpg // 

This man and woman standing on top of the mountain are like two peas in a pod, except the woman's the only one doing any climbing!


demo/IMG-2181.jpg // 

This man and woman must be really sure of themselves, standing on top of a mountain like they own it! But I guess when you put two egos together, you create an even bigger mountain!


demo/rhtrpjleji.png // 

You must really think you're cool for giving a thumbs up in a room. It's like you invented the concept of being a thumbs up guy. No one else can come close to your level of thumbs up prowess.


demo/fponjcvbbs.png // 

You must really be hungry if you're bringing a fork and knife to a gunfight!
